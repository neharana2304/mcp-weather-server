 MCP Weather & Forecast Server
This project is a Model Contextual Protocol (MCP)-based server that delivers real-time weather and forecast responses using Claude Desktop as the runtime. It demonstrates how contextual prompting and modular AI tools can be combined for a practical application.

**Features**
Real-time current weather and multi-day forecasts
Structured prompt-response flow using MCP protocol
Modular and extendable design
Powered by Claude Desktop for local AI interaction

**How It Works**
User inputs a weather-related query (e.g., "What's the forecast for Paris tomorrow?")
The MCP server formats the prompt contextually
Claude Desktop handles the model interaction
Response is parsed and delivered in a readable format
