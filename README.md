## 🚀 Features

- Real-time **current weather** and **multi-day forecast** capability
- Built using **Claude Desktop** for local inference
- Structured prompt-response handling using the **MCP protocol**
- Easy to extend for new data domains or use cases

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User sends a natural language query (e.g., "What's the weather in Delhi tomorrow?")
2. The server formats this into a structured MCP prompt
3. Claude Desktop processes the input and generates the response
4. The result is parsed and returned to the user

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Claude Desktop** (local model runtime)
- **MCP Protocol**
- **Python** for orchestration logic
- *(Optional)* Weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, if external data is used)
